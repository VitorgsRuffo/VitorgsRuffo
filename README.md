    My focus has always been on learning computer science fundamentals, such as problem-solving, algorithms, data structures, computer architecture, etc. I'm not concerned about learning a specific stack     of development technologies, but I'm willing to know any of them if needed. I have already got some initial experience with some technologies such as C, Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and     PostgreSQL.
