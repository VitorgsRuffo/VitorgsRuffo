   My focus is to learn computer science fundamentals, such as computer architecture, algorithms, data structures, etc. I'm not concerned about learning a      specific stack of development technologies, but I'm willing to learn any of them if I need it. By the way, I have already got some initial experience with some technologies such as C, Java, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MySQL. Currently, I'm working on an undergraduate research project. It involves anomaly detection in Software Defined Networks using deep neural networks and IP flow analysis.
